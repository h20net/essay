<h1 style="color:red;">How to Write an Essay</h1>
<h2>Upper Secondary</h2>

<p>Step 1: read the assignment<br>
  <br>
  Decide what kind of essay it is - opinion OR for and against<br>
  <br>
  Step 2: underline key words<br>
  <br>
  Underline key <u>vocabulary</u> in the question and write words with the same or related<br>
  meaning (synonyms) or use a couple of words to express the same (rephrase). This<br>
   will really save you a lot of time later on. It will also help you avoid repeating words.<br>
   <br>
   Step 3: get ideas<br>
   <br>
   Think of arguments and reasons or examples to support your ideas.<br>
   Think of counterarguments and reasons or examples to support your ideas.<br>
   Give your opinion in the conclusion<br>
   <br>
   Step 4: make a layout<br>
   <br>
   Write a plan for your essay, write down key words, you will use <u>four</u>paragraphs:<br>
   <br>
   1.   Introduction: 3 sentences<br>
   2.   Two arguments + reasons or examples: 7 sentences<br>
   3.   Two counterarguments + reasons or examples: 7 sentences<br>
   4.   Conclusion: 3 sentences<br>
   This will give you 20 sentences. An average of 10 words each, that is 200 words.<br>
   <br>
   Step 5: write<br>
   <br>
   Use your plan (steps 3 and 4) and the vocabulary from step 1 to write your essay.<br>
   Remember to use <u>phrases for presenting arguments</u> (p.19) and <u>linking words</u> (p. 20)<br>
   <br><br>

<h3>Two Arguments FOR</h3><br>

<form>
      <fieldset>
        <p><u>Some people think that</u> it is impossible to function without your mobile phone. They <br>
          need it to teel the time, check their agenda and to stay in touch with their friends.<br>
          <u>Many people feel that</u> they need to respond to every message or picture sent to them<br>
          straightaway.<br>
          <u>However</u>, pupils can easily contact their parents in case on an emergancy.<br>
          <br>
          <u>While it is true that</u> there are many useful apps that help you study, <u>I think</u> it is<br>
          essential to find excellent educational apps at low cost.<br>
          <u>I feel that</u> pupils can then work in their own tempo, whenever and wherever they want.
      </p>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
    <br><br><br>
<h3> Two Argments AGAINST</h3>
<br>
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <p><u>On the other hand</u>, young people spend enough screen time as it is.<br>
      <u>Although many people argue that</u> in the 21st century pupils will learn best by using<br>
      apps is school, <u>in fact the opposite is truebr</u>. Research has shown that pupils are more <br>
      easily distracted and remember less from e-learning<br>
      <u>Moreover</u>, according to a survay by Common Sense.org as many as 50% of teens<br>
      feel they are addited to their phones.
  </fieldset>
</form>
<br><br><br>
<h3>4 Concluson</h3>
<br>
<p>Use different words to rewrite your introduction and summorize paragraphs one and<br>
   to write your conclusion:<br>
   <br>
   Your introduction:<br>
   <br></p>
   <form>
     <fieldset>
       <p><i>There are <u>few people</u> today who could survice without their mobile phones.<br>
         <u>Nevertheless</u> some people seem to become addit to them. Should we ban mobiles from schools?<br></i></p>
     </fieldset>
   </form>
   <br><br>
   <p>Your conclusion</p><br>
   <br>
   <form>
     <fieldset>
       <p><u>All in all</u>, mobile phones can be really useful to keep in touch with your parents and<br>
         friends. In the classroom they can be a learning tool.<u> However</u>, some pupils cannot<br>
       put them down and pay attention in class. <u> I think</u> these pupils should receive help.<u> In<br>
       the end</u>, parents feel a lot happier if their children can call for help on their way to and<br>
     from school.</p>
