<h1 style="color:red;">How to Write an Essay</h1>
<h2>Upper Secondary</h2>

<p>Step 1: read the assignment<br>
  <br>
  Decide what kind of essay it is - opinion OR for and against<br>
  <br>
  Step 2: underline key words<br>
  <br>
  Underline key <u>vocabulary</u> in the question and write words with the same or related<br>
  meaning (synonyms) or use a couple of words to express the same (rephrase). This<br>
   will really save you a lot of time later on. It will also help you avoid repeating words.<br>
   <br>
   Step 3: get ideas<br>
   <br>
   Think of arguments and reasons or examples to support your ideas.<br>
   Think of counterarguments and reasons or examples to support your ideas.<br>
   Give your opinion in the conclusion<br>
   <br>
   Step 4: make a layout<br>
   <br>
   Write a plan for your essay, write down key words, you will use <u>four</u>paragraphs:<br>
   <br>
   1.   Introduction: 3 sentences<br>
   2.   Two arguments + reasons or examples: 7 sentences<br>
   3.   Two counterarguments + reasons or examples: 7 sentences<br>
   4.   Conclusion: 3 sentences<br>
   This will give you 20 sentences. An average of 10 words each, that is 200 words.<br>
   <br>
   Step 5: write<br>
   <br>
   Use your plan (steps 3 and 4) and the vocabulary from step 1 to write your essay.<br>
   Remember to use <u>phrases for presenting arguments</u> (p.19) and <u>linking words</u> (p. 20)<br>
